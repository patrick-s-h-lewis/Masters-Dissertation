A large dataset of chemistry literature meta-data was built up by automated scraping from freely-available online sources. A UK Chemistry Department dataset of chemical literature meta-data was built up by a similar method. Novel Natural Language Processing algorithms were used to develop powerful models to represent the chemical semantic space. These models were analysed and visualisation techniques were developed. The utility of the models was demonstrated by investigating relationships between researchers at the University of Cambridge Chemistry Department.
