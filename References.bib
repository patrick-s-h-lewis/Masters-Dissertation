@Inproceedings {word2veckingqueen,
abstract     = {<p>Continuous space language models have recently demonstrated outstanding
                results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we examine the vector-space
                word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We
                find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and
                semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by
                a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on
                the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is
                automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man +
                Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word
                vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions
                (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40{\%} of the
                questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by
                using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions.
                Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems.</p>},
