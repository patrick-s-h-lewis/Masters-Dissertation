\chapter{Analysis with Sample Dataset}
Having developed a framework to examine the models, attention was turned to some example analyses that could be carried out. Many possible applications for the framework suggest themselves, but the finite nature of the project necessitated focussing on analyses that could be achieved within the time-frame. \footnote{Please refer to section \ref{chapt:RECOMMENDATIONS} for more treatments}. With this in mind, it was decided to focus analysis on the a smaller subset of the training dataset, namely documents from the University of Cambridge Chemistry Department. This dataset is henceforth referred to as \emph{CCD}\footnote{Cambridge Chemistry Dataset}.
\section{Cambridge Chemistry research clusters}
\label{sec:RESEARCHCLUSTERS}
The CCD contained 9467 documents. The cosine matrix was calculated and a network was constructed from the matrix. \emph{communities} within the network (clusters of strongly connected nodes) were identified by applying a high performance modularity algorithm\cite{modularity1}\cite{modularity2}. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:CAMCOMMUNITIES}.
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:CAMCOMMUNITIES}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.05]{Analysis/cam.png}
    \caption{A Network visualisation of the CCD. Edges were placed between nodes with weight equalling cosine similarity if $S_{Cosine}$. Nodes are coloured into their detected communities, and node size is proportional to the number of connections a node has. nodes are arranged by modelling edges as springs.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
It is apparent that the CCD contains contains clear communities of documents. This corresponds to different fields of research within the department. Some communities detected were small, but some were large (green, orange, etc...). The algorithm was then applied only to `green' community to reveal subcommunities within the `green' documents. A program was then written to recursively detect subcommunities in the CCD. This resulted in the CCD being divided into 300 communities of comparable size. The smallest communities were singleton documents, the largest community was 434 documents, and the mean population was 34.5. The community finding subdivision process is shown in figure \ref{fig:COMMTREE}
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:COMMTREE}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Analysis/comms.png}
    \caption{Recursion Tree depicting how communities were found. The dataset was partitioned using the modularity algorithm. Partitions with more than 100 documents were then repartitioned recursively. Partitions of less than 100 documents were considered to be communities (shown red in the diagram). The figure shows the maximum depth of partition required was 8, and most communities were found after 3 partitions.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
Figure \ref{fig:COMMTREE} can be interpreted as the \emph{relationship} between different fields of research within the department. It is a shallow tree with highly branched nodes, suggesting that wide research fields, and qualitative overlap between fields.
The process described is equivalent to an unsupervised categorisation algorithm. The entire process, from model training to finding communities has been without human labelling or intuition. It was therefore instructive to examine what the algorithm defined as communities.
Communities were then analysed vigorously. Community clustering made intuitive sense in the majority of cases. Community 275 is typical:

Table \ref{tab:com275} shows that this particular research community referes mainly to toxicology studies neonicotinoids,  bees and flowers\footnote{Note only some members of the community are shown above. Care was taken to give a representative sample of all 15 articles. The rest refer to Neonicotinoid insecticide studies with honey bees, and honey bee affinity to corn and pollen}. The connections mostly make sense. Note the surprising inclusion of the cosmetics and lanthanide silicate studies. Upon investigation, both studies use very similar analytical techniques used elsewhere in the community, and both examined intercalation.
\footnote{Both used made use of powder X-ray diffraction, and the silicates paper used thermogravimetry, the cosmetics study uses FID and several types of liquid chromatography, all methods used in the bee/nicotinoid studies.}

Note also that the mean vector for the community was closest to a paper in the training set that summarised the community extremely well. This paper could be considered as a \emph{Summary paper.}
The uses of this kind of analysis include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis of literature field - plotting trees such as figure \ref{fig:COMMTREE} can give a relational understanding of how facets of a field link up together. 
\item Research tool: If researching a paper, finding its community immediately provides the researcher with papers that are related to it. Crucially this is done without simply following citations, so that interesting, perhaps overlooked links between papers can be found.
\item Summarising: If a researcher is required to read many papers from a field, they could find the communities involved and begin by reading the 'summary' papers. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Cambridge Staff Member Similarities}
\label{sec:AUTHORCLUSTERS}

It is not only articles themselves that can be grouped and analysed, but articles can be aggregated together to represent higher collections, such as staff members or research groups, or potentially even departments. 
To investigate this further, \texttt{http://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/publications/authors} was scraped in order to associate the documents in the CCD with particular staff members groups. A staff member vector $\textbf{f}$ was defined as $\mathbf{f}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N} \mathbf{v}_i$ , for an author with $N$ published articles in the CCD, with document vectors $\mathbf{v}_i$ (vector mean).

To investigate author relationships, a cosine matrix was created for each pair of authors A and B, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ documents respectively, $\mathbf{C^{\left( A \right ) , \left( B \right)}}$ (see section\ref{sec:COSINEMAT}). The similarity between the author pair was defined as 
$$S_{A , B} = \sum_{i}^{\alpha} \sum_{j}^{\beta} C^{\left( A \right) , \left( B \right) }_{ i , j }$$
An Author similarity matrix can then be built up $\mathbf{S}$, with elements $\mathbf{S}_{ A , B }=S_{ A , B }$.
A similar technique could have been used to create clusters of authors. However, the sample size was now much smaller, so a more appropriate technique was hierarchical clustering, specifically UPGMA \footnote{Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean} \cite{heatmapcluster}. This method clusters the authors pairwise in a hierarchical fashion.  An effective visualisation of the similarities between staff was to plot a \emph{clustermap} \cite{seaborn} \cite{scipy}.
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:AUTHORSIMS}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Analysis/authorsims.png}
    \caption{This figure shows a heatmap of Author similarity. Dark pixels correspond to the author in the pixel's row having similar research interests to the author in the pixcel's column. The authors are arranged by clusters found in UPGMA of authors. The authors are also diagrammatically connected by a dendrogram. This shows the hierarchical structure of the clustering.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
Figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS} shows the result of generating $\textbf{S}$ and performing a UPGMA hierarchical clustering. The authors are labelled by their crsids. The dendrogram tree links authors pairwise, illustrating how the clustering was performed, and how closely related clusters are. An enlarged dendrogram is shown below:
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:DENDRO}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/dendro.png}
    \caption{The dendrogram of figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS}} plotted for clarity
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
A striking feature of figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS} is the cluster in the bottom right corner. The dendrogram tree shows the members of this cluster occupy a separate branch of research space than the rest of the department. The staff members involved, Professor Jones, Dr. Harris, Professor Pyle Dr. Archibald and Dr. Kalberer are all members of the Centre for Atmospheric Science. The unsupervised model thus successfully `predicted' their department, and indicated that their work is quite far removed from most of the work in the Chemistry Department. This is a real success for the model. The dendrogram was then further examined and broken into distinct branches. Each branch was examined and manually labelled. The results are shown in figure \ref{sec:LABELLEDDENDRO}. Most clusters make intuitive sense, but there is one core of well connected, more disparate members (wj10 to jrn34). These members could be interpreted as being an interdisciplinary cluster.  
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:LABELLEDDENDRO}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/dendro_overlay2.png}
    \caption{Cluster labels overlayed over the distinct branches of the dendrogram.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
The analysis's value is self evident. Clusters of similar staff members informs the department about the width of research (number of clusters), and how resources are partitioned (size of clusters). It should also be stressed that authors are associated without any human preconceptions or bias. Thus perhaps the most valuable author associations are the unexpected ones, and authors should be encouraged to examine their cluster and consider their `neighbours'.
\section{Combining research clusters and authors}
As a final data examination, topic communities found in section \ref{sec:RESEARCHCLUSTERS} were linked to the authors in the department. Different metrics for author similarity were developed to see if they correlated with the maps produced in the previous section.
Firstly, for a topic community $\mathfrak{C}$, with documents $d \in \mathfrak{C}$, and an author $\mathfrak{A}$ with documents $\delta \in \mathfrak{A}$, we can associate the author with the community if $\mathfrak{C} \cap \mathfrak{A} \neq \{ \}$, \footnote{or equivalently $\exists  \partial : \partial \in \mathfrak{C} \wedge \partial \in \mathfrak{A} $}. The function $f_{assoc}$ was defined as 
\[ 
f_{assoc}\left( \mathfrak{C} , \mathfrak{A} \right) = \begin{cases} 
      0 & \mathfrak{C} \cap \mathfrak{A} = \{ \} \\
      1 & \mathfrak{C} \cap \mathfrak{A} \neq \{ \} 
   \end{cases}
\]
It was noted that there was significant variation in the number of communities that researchers were associated with. A plot of $\sum_c^C f_{assoc} \left( \mathfrak{C}_c , \mathfrak{A} \right)$ for each author is shown below.:
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:commbar}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/community_detection.png}
    \caption{Number of research communities authors are associated with. High values indicate an author publishing across many communities, suggest more interdisciplinary work, but also higher publication count per author. (The same plot, scaled for publication count) is included in the appendix}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
It can be seen that some authors are widely distributed between communities, whereas others are concentrated.
It should be appreciated that communities are not uniformly distributed across work done in the department. For example there are many communities in `Life Sciences' but few in Atmospheric Chemistry, as such, interpretation of high values in Figure \ref{fig:commbar} corresponding 1:1 to wide research interests is cautious.

An association metric $S_{coincidence}$ between authors $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ was then defined as $$S_{coincidence}\left( \mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{B} \right) = \sum_c^C \left(f_{assoc} \left( \mathfrak{C}_c , \mathfrak{A} \right) f_{assoc}\left( \mathfrak{C}_c , \mathfrak{B} \right) \right) $$
Where $C$ is the total number of communities. An association matrix was created, $\mathbf{S}^{Assoc}_{\mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{B}} = S_{coincidence}\left( \mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{B} \right)$, where high values for author pair $\mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{B}$ indicate they appear in lots of research communities together. The matrix was then scaled such that: $\mathbf{S}^{Assoc,scaled}_{\mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{B}} =  \mathbf{S}^{Assoc}_{\mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{B}} /  \left( \mathbf{S}^{Assoc}_{\mathfrak{A} , \mathfrak{A}} + \mathbf{S}^{Assoc}_{\mathfrak{B} , \mathfrak{B}} \right) $, and normalised to the range 0,1. This was a measure of how often researchers can be found in the same communities. The matrix is shown below. 
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:commHEATMAP}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/author_comm_heatmap.png}
    \caption{Heatmap showing author-author pair values for how often authors publish works in the same communities. High values indicated that Authors are predicted to have similar publication profiles. Note the authors are arranged with the ordering from figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS}.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
Figure \ref{fig:commHEATMAP} indicates where authors have been detected to have similar research community occupations. High values should indicate that authors should ideally collaborate/communicate because they publish in the same research communities. Note also that the square patterns near the diagonal of the plot reproduce the clustering in figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS}, lending weight to the validity of both analyses.\footnote{This is because the heatmap has been arranged according to the clustering found in section \ref{sec:AUTHORCLUSTERS}, but the matrix is derived in a completely different way (without applying any  clustering algorithm to the authors). Because clustering is qualitatively visible in figure \ref{fig:commHEATMAP}, there is a correlation between the two methods, i.e. they are consistent}.

Having defined a framework for finding where authors share research interest, the next step was to find where authors were \emph{actually} collaborating. It was possible to identify .... documents in CCD that were co-authored by staff members in the analysis. A heatmap for actual collaboration between authors is shown below, as well as a metric equivalent to the $\mathbf{S}^{Assoc,scaled}$ where elements are the sum of the number of communities both staff members have collaborated in.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
  \label{fig:rawcollabs}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Analysis/raw_collabs.png}
    \caption{Raw collaboration matrix (values scaled to range 0,1). Note the general lack of co-publishing between staff members. Again staff are ordered by clustering described in section \ref{sec:AUTHORCLUSTERS}, but no actual clustering has been performed. Hot spots near the diagonal suggest that author pairs clustered together in \ref{sec:AUTHORCLUSTERS} generally collaborate more than distant author pairs.  }
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
  \label{fig:collcollabs}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Analysis/comm_collabs.png}
    \caption{Matrix formed by summing collaboration of author pairs over research communities (values scaled to range 0,1). Qualitatively similar to \ref{fig:rawcollabs}. Hot spots near diagonal again suggest authors closely clustered in section \ref{sec:AUTHORCLUSTERS} collaborate more frequently }
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Both pictures show the same qualitative picture. Similar author pairs (close to diagonal) are more likely to collaborate. 

As a final data treatment, a matrix defined as the difference between an author similarity matrix (e.g figures \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS}, \ref{fig:commHEATMAP}) and an author collaboration matrix (e.g. figures \ref{fig:rawcollabs}, \ref{fig:collcollabs}) is interpretable as a \emph{recommended collaboration matrix}, i.e. where values close to 1 indicate high similarity but low collaboration, and values close to zero indicate effective collaboration and values close to -1 indicate high collaboration but low author similarity. Author Pairs with values to 1 should be encouraged to work together. This matrix is shown below:
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:RECOMM_MAT}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/Recommending_Mat.png}
    \caption{Recommending matrix. High values (Deep red) indicate authors that have similar research but do not collaborate on published works. Values $\sim$ 0 (grey/white) are where authors are neither similar nor collaborate. Values towards -1, (Blue) indicate authors that are collaborate but do share similar research (not strongly observed, as expected. High negative values would be somewhat paradoxical.) }
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
This final piece of the analysis section illustrates how the framework developed over the research project reveals where it might be profitable for authors to collaborate. Returning to the Centre for Atmospheric Science, which was highlighted as a tight, separate research community, it can be seen that there are recommendations for greater collaboration between particular authors within the Centre. The matrix row for a particular staff member (Professor Goodman) is plotted below by way of example:
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:RECOMM_MAT}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/jmg.png}
    \caption{Recommendations for a particular staff member, Professor Goodman. (Bars very close to zero have been removed). }
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
The aim is that these maps and plots may trigger new, constructive debate and promote effective collaboration in the department. The analyses presented in this section are not exhaustive, and there is potential for more fruitful insights to be found. Please see section \ref{sec:RECOMMENDATIONS}
