\chapter{Analysis with Sample Dataset}
Having developed a framework to examine the models, attention was turned to some example analyses that could be carried out. Many possible applications for the framework suggest themselves, but the finite nature of the project necessitated focussing on analyses that could be achieved within the time-frame. \footnote{Please refer to section \ref{chapt:RECOMMENDATIONS} for more treatments}. With this in mind, it was decided to focus analysis on the a smaller subset of the training dataset, namely documents from the University of Cambridge Chemistry Department. This dataset is henceforth referred to as \emph{CCD}\footnote{Cambridge Chemistry Dataset}.
\section{Cambridge Chemistry research clusters}
The CCD contained 9467 documents. The cosine matrix was calculated and a network was constructed from the matrix. \emph{communities} within the network (clusters of strongly connected nodes) were identified by applying a high performance modularity algorithm\cite{modularity1}\cite{modularity2}. The result is shown in figure \ref{fig:CAMCOMMUNITIES}.

    \caption{A Network visualisation of the CCD. Edges were placed between nodes with weight equalling cosine similarity if $S_{Cosine}$. Nodes are coloured into their detected communities, and node size is proportional to the number of connections a node has. nodes are arranged by modelling edges as springs.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
It is apparent that the CCD contains contains clear communities of documents. This corresponds to different fields of research within the department. Some communities detected were small, but some were large (green, orange, etc...). The algorithm was then applied only to `green' community to reveal subcommunities within the `green' documents. A program was then written to recursively detect subcommunities in the CCD. This resulted in the CCD being divided into 300 communities of comparable size. The smallest communities were singleton documents, the largest community was 434 documents, and the mean population was 34.5. The community finding subdivision process is shown in figure \ref{fig:COMMTREE}
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:COMMTREE}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Analysis/comms.png}
    \caption{Recursion Tree depicting how communities were found. The dataset was partitioned using the modularity algorithm. Partitions with more than 100 documents were then repartitioned recursively. Partitions of less than 100 documents were considered to be communities (shown red in the diagram). The figure shows the maximum depth of partition required was 8, and most communities were found after 3 partitions.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
Figure \ref{fig:COMMTREE} can be interpreted as the \emph{relationship} between different fields of research within the department. It is a shallow tree with highly branched nodes, suggesting that wide research fields, and qualitative overlap between fields.
The process described is equivalent to an unsupervised categorisation algorithm. The entire process, from model training to finding communities has been without human labelling or intuition. It was therefore instructive to examine what the algorithm defined as communities.
Communities were then analysed vigorously. Community clustering made intuitive sense in the majority of cases. Community 275 is typical:

Table \ref{tab:com275} shows that this particular research community referes mainly to toxicology studies neonicotinoids,  bees and flowers\footnote{Note only some members of the community are shown above. Care was taken to give a representative sample of all 15 articles. The rest refer to Neonicotinoid insecticide studies with honey bees, and honey bee affinity to corn and pollen}. The connections mostly make sense. Note the surprising inclusion of the cosmetics and lanthanide silicate studies. Upon investigation, both studies use very similar analytical techniques used elsewhere in the community, and both examined intercalation.
\footnote{Both used made use of powder X-ray diffraction, and the silicates paper used thermogravimetry, the cosmetics study uses FID and several types of liquid chromatography, all methods used in the bee/nicotinoid studies.}

Note also that the mean vector for the community was closest to a paper in the training set that summarised the community extremely well. This paper could be considered as a \emph{Summary paper.}
The uses of this kind of analysis include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Analysis of literature field - plotting trees such as figure \ref{fig:COMMTREE} can give a relational understanding of how facets of a field link up together. 
\item Research tool: If researching a paper, finding its community immediately provides the researcher with papers that are related to it. Crucially this is done without simply following citations, so that interesting, perhaps overlooked links between papers can be found.
\item Summarising: If a researcher is required to read many papers from a field, they could find the communities involved and begin by reading the 'summary' papers. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Cambridge Staff Member Similarities}
It is not only articles themselves that can be grouped and analysed, but articles can be aggregated together to represent higher collections, such as staff members or research groups, or potentially even departments. 
To investigate this further, \texttt{http://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/publications/authors} was scraped in order to associate the documents in the CCD with particular staff members groups. A staff member vector $\textbf{f}$ was defined as $\mathbf{f}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N} \mathbf{v}_i$ , for an author with $N$ published articles in the CCD, with document vectors $\mathbf{v}_i$ (vector mean).

To investigate author relationships, a cosine matrix was created for each pair of authors A and B, with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ documents respectively, $\mathbf{C^{\left( A \right ) , \left( B \right)}}$ (see section\ref{sec:COSINEMAT}). The similarity between the author pair was defined as 
$$S_{A , B} = \sum_{i}^{\alpha} \sum_{j}^{\beta} C^{\left( A \right) , \left( B \right) }_{ i , j }$$
An Author similarity matrix can then be built up $\mathbf{S}$, with elements $\mathbf{S}_{ A , B }=S_{ A , B }$.
A similar technique could have been used to create clusters of authors. However, the sample size was now much smaller, so a more appropriate technique was hierarchical clustering, specifically UPGMA \footnote{Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean} \cite{heatmapcluster}. This method clusters the authors pairwise in a hierarchical fashion.  An effective visualisation of the similarities between staff was to plot a \emph{clustermap} \cite{seaborn} \cite{scipy}.
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:AUTHORSIMS}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Analysis/authorsims.png}
    \caption{This figure shows a heatmap of Author similarity. Dark pixels correspond to the author in the pixel's row having similar research interests to the author in the pixcel's column. The authors are arranged by clusters found in UPGMA of authors. The authors are also diagrammatically connected by a dendrogram. This shows the hierarchical structure of the clustering.}
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
Figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS} shows the result of generating $\textbf{S}$ and performing a UPGMA hierarchical clustering. The authors are labelled by their crsids. The dendrogram tree links authors pairwise, illustrating how the clustering was performed, and how closely related clusters are. An enlarged dendrogram is shown below:
\begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\label{fig:DENDRO}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Analysis/dendro.png}
    \caption{The dendrogram of figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS}} plotted for clarity
\end{figure} 
\end{center}
A striking feature of figure \ref{fig:AUTHORSIMS} is the cluster in the bottom right corner. The members of this cluster (as shown in the dendrogram) occupy a separate branch of research space than the rest of the department. The staff members involved, Professor Jones, Dr. Harris, Professor Pyle Dr. Archibald and Dr. Kalberer are all in the Centre for Atmospheric Science. The unsupervised model has thus successfully predicted their department, and indicates that their work is quite far removed from most of the work in the Chemistry Department. This is a real success for the model.
