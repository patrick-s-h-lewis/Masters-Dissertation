It was mentioned in \S\ref{sec:COSINEMAT} that singletons (articles with few to no connections to others or those that form their own community)in the graph were predicted to be significantly different to most articles. The singletons produced analysing $\Delta7$ in \S\ref{sec:RESEARCHCLUSTERS} were examined to test this hypothesis.

It was certainly the case that some of the 33 singletons produced in the community finding process were poorly formatted or different. There was one article that detailed RSC award winners, one symposium handout, and 14 did not have well resolved abstracts. However the majority of singletons appeared to be mostly normal (if not quite narrow-scope) articles. The average number of words in a singleton document was lower than the average for $\Delta7$ (65.7 words vs 125.7). It appears that in the majority of cases, singletons lie 'just outside' a threshold for inclusion, rather than being freak anomalies.
